Spex: Building Ruby from source
===========================

This is a simple example designed to show how to install Ruby from source rather then a pre-built package.

The example here installs Ruby 2.1.2, the latest stable version as of August 2014. If you need to download a different version, check out the [Ruby download page] (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and update `ops/build_ruby_from_source.sh` as necessary
