Spex: Guard Growl
===========================

Building on the setup using Guard, Spring and RSpec, this branch shows how to trigger Growl notifications on your host system. The only tricky thing is in telling the gest OS the IP address of the host machine.
This is handled with the script `setup_guest_bash_profile.sh`
