Spex: Rspec Guard Spork
===========================

Building on the base_rails_app, we now want to start testing our app.

I have created a simple static homepage that we will write test(s) against.

This branch shows how to setup a very basic install with [Guard] (https://github.com/guard/guard) and [Rspec] (http://rspec.info/). The tests are pretty trivial, but they show how to exercise the Guardfile, that's used to run Rspec when your files change.

For more details, read my post about the process [on my blog] (http://eyefodder.com/2014/09/guard-and-rspec.html)
