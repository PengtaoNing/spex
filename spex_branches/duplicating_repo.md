Spex: Duplicating a repository
===========================

This branch shows a way of duplicating a github repository and rails app. There is no connection / history between original and duplicated repo, and all named references to the orginal app are replaced with the name of the new app.

For more details, read my post about the process [on my blog] (http://eyefodder.com/2014/09/duplicate-git-repository.html)
