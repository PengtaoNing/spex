Spex: Rspec, Guard and Spring
===========================

[Spring] (https://github.com/rails/spring) is a great way to speed up development. It keeps your application running in the background so it doesn't need to reload everytime you want to re-run a test. This makes it great for pairing with [Guard] (https://github.com/guard/guard) and [Rspec] (http://rspec.info/)

For more details on this branch, read my post about the setup process [on my blog] (http://eyefodder.com/2014/09/using-spring-with-rspec-and-guard.html â€Ž)
